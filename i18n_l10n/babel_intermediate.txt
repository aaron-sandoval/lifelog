EXTRACTION SUMMARY (MANUAL ENTRY): Exhibit.py and all pages
_("Welcome to Deep Lifelog, my first serious data analysis project! Since I started grad school in September 2017, I've collected continuous time series tabular data on my daily activities. It started as a small productivity exercise to track my academic tasks, but as my data obsession kicked in the scope ballooned out of control :smile:. I was inspired by [r/dataisbeautiful content like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/ab4uzz/i_recorded_every_hour_of_my_2018_and_17_oc/), but I wanted to track way more detail than a single categorical variable over fixed intervals. Over the years, I've adding data features like:")
_('- Media consumed\n- People I spend time with\n- Food\n- Location\n- Subject matters researched/discussed')
_("Though all of those features are in the data, there is more feature engineering and visualization work to be done. In addition to being an exercise in data analysis and software engineering, this project is also a mode of introspection, one more objective than fallible memory. Of course, this is all going to be much more interesting to me that it is to anyone else, so I'll try to focus on relatable ideas before diving down weird rabbit holes.")
_('Genre.Fiction')
_('**Future work**')
_("There's so much to see in the details of this plot. Like how data collection was consistently incomplete until 2018-06. This is probably because, when I started my first job, I used this same data to fill in my timesheet at work, and I got into the habit of logging data more precisely at all hours. ")
_("Much of the design work in this project has been in abstracting as much as possible about daily activities into data structures like `Project`, `Tag`, `Collectible`, etc. At the top of the `Project` taxonomy is the `Metaproject`, a set of 5 broad categories which together contain every `Project`. This is a useful data feature to begin with in a top-down analysis approach, since major shifts in lifestyle are evident while smaller details don't muddy the waters.")
_('Metaprojects')
_("Or the big zero-sum spike-trough pairs poking above the 24-hour total line. I'm not sure what is causing them. Most likely some unclean data. ")
_('- Check out the spikes about 24 hours noted above.\n- Add labels for smaller events like the short cycle tours in 2019 and 2021.\n- Split this plot into 2 subplots looking at weekdays and weekends.')
_('I like how this plot illustrates the phases of my adult life with different `Metaproject` focus. You can easily see the shifts from grad school, to working, to long-haul cycle touring in 2022, and to independent study in 2023. ')
_('Or comparing how overworked I was in grad school vs in the busiest periods in my first job. Grad school was consistently more consuming than work, with only 2 spikes around 2021-01 coming close. ')
_('Or how as my studies in Spring 2018 gradually ate up more time over the course of the semester, it was mostly {0} which was sacrificed, {1} only dropping a bit. ')
_("The {0} prevalence is obvious. The right subplot shows the overall proportion of time by gender, with {0} occupying around 75% of the total. Grad school in the first half of 2018 was clearly {0}-dominated. That eased up in 2019, when, I hypothesize, my job became more collaborative within a gender-balanced team. Spikes around July, November, or December make sense, since that's when I usually visit my dad's family and spend time with my grandma, aunts, and cousins.")
_("So hypothesizing that the right side of the distribution looks about the same for most people, I'm curious how the shape of the left side of the distribution would compare. I can imagine social behavior patterns which might produce negative curvature at the left side. How common is this compared to positive curvature? ")
_('*2018-02*: Started regularly collecting data on time spent with individual people.')
_("The pandemic didn't have much of an effect in this plot apart from maybe being responsible for the dip in 2020-03 through 2020-04. But this apparent lack of effect may just be a coincidence. A roommate moved in in 2020-04, and we spent lots of time cooped up together for the next 12 months. Perhaps the social time with colleagues was merely approximately supplanted by social time with my roommate. Looking at other demographics will tell.")
_("The variance of the `Wake up` distributions also appears to be decreasing over time, visible in the diminishing interquartile range. Certainly, my schedule during `{0}` was comparatively irregular. From subjective memory, during `{2}` and `{3}`, my sleep schedule on weekdays and weekends had little distinction, but that's a claim that can be backed by data at some point.")
_('Gender')
_('- Compare weekday and weekend distributions\n- Scatterplot of `Wake up` vs `Fall asleep` to examine correlation')
_('People')
_("Every Person has a {4}, and some people have multiple. In those instances, the primary {4} follows the order of precedence in the above list. So when I'm with a {2} who's grown close enough to be considered a {1}, that would be considered time with a {1} in this analysis. ")
_("It's interesting to compare the shapes of the `Fall asleep` and `Wake up` distributions for each phase. Ignoring the long tails, there's clearly a rough correspondence in shape for each pair. The bimodal distributions of `{1}` likely correspond to weekdays and weekends. I'd estimate that the bimodality is clearer for `Wake up` just because waking time is controlled by an alarm clock.")
_('Primary Relation')
_("Gender is classified into the mutually-exclusive categories {0}. {1} is used for entries in the `Person` catalog which don't correspond to individual people. For example, there are several `Person` instances which actually correspond to teams and other groups, all of which use {1} unless the group is single-gendered. ")
_("This plot shows an overview of my sleep behavior related to time of day over different phases of life. The most obvious feature is the distributional shift between `{0}` and `{1}`, when median sleep behavior shifted earlier by 2+ hours. The shift in modes is even greater, shifting by about 3 hours. I recall this transition from moderate night owl to early bird feeling pretty easy. I've never been a caffeine drinker, and waking early has never been a problem.")
_('The only month in which I spent more time with women was 2022-03. This month was an anomaly within an anomaly. The outer anomaly was the lonely cycle tour spanning 2022, and the inner anomaly was the two weeks in 2022-03 when I toured along with two girls Suzie and Veronika, during which we spent nearly every hour together. The other 2022 anomaly was 2022-09, when I spent a week in Germany with several friends from back home.')
_('Sleep is one of the most basic features in the dataset, and one which spans the full collection period with little change in collection behavior.')
_('- Decompose remaining groups logged as {1} into their constituent individuals')
_("There are plenty of questions this plot raises to be investigated further. I'm not sure what caused the spike in 2022-10 through 2022-11, nor the dip in 2021-02. ")
_("This is probably the data feature which has the most potential for interesting analysis. Due to signal-to-noise ratio, data on time spent with people is particularly susceptible to collection errors for people with whom I've spent little time. I usually decide whether to add a new person to the dataset if I've interacted with them meaningfully for >15 minutes or expect to in the future. But I make frequent errors in both directions relative to this rule of thumb, adding noise to the data most visible in the long tail of people with whom I've spent little time. ")
_("But this measure does not reflect how much of my time I spend socializing in general. I expect there to be quite a difference between a plot of 'Hours per Day of Social Interaction' and the total profile of person-hours per day in the plot below. Person-hours is a measure more susceptible to data collection errors than a simple measure of hours. There's plenty of social time where I didn't record the identities of the people involved, and all of that data is filtered out during any analysis of person-hours. Also, large gatherings contribute heavily to person-hours due to the quantity of people, but the limitations of data collection frequently lead to misleading results. For example, if I go to a party with 3 friends, but there are 12 other people whose names I don't know, that party will be logged as time spent with 3 people, not 15. And maybe that incomplete data is actually a more honest representation of the time than if I did log all 15 people. Should it really count as 15 people if you don't really know 12 of them and you only even talked to 6? It depends on your semantics of 'social interaction'. It's good to keep this in mind when interpreting this plot and others showing units of 'person-hours'.")
_('*2023-12-13*: Began explicitly logging all sleep tasks instead of assuming untracked intervals are sleep. Change disambiguates naps from occasional erroneously unlogged intervals.')
_('**Data Collection Changelog**')
_("Excluding people with whom I've spent <3 hours with in total, where the data is noisy, the distribution of time spent is even more skewed than a power law distribution. That is to say, the curve has distinctly positive curvature in a log plot, not a linear relationship. What would others' plots look like if they had collected a lifelog dataset? I imagine that everyone's version of this plot would have positive log plot curvature in at least the rightmost region. This is assuming an ideal scenario where data collection is comprehensive, down to the 30 seconds spent chatting with Tina the grocery clerk, and maybe even brief moments of eye contact with strangers. It depends on where you draw the line for what constitutes a social interaction. In the ideal case where all this data is collected, the dataset would include thousands of people in a long tail of very little time spent together, and I suspect that this tail would generally show positive log plot curvature in everyone's plot.")
_("Primary relations are another high-level lens through which to characterize my social time. Analyzing primary relation can distinguish when I'm having fun with my friends vs meeting with work colleagues or hanging out with family. The types of primary relation are :\n1. {0}\n1. {1}\n1. {2}\n1. {3}")
_('- Create a scalar metric of breadth/tightness of social activities related to the curvature of the semilog plot. Evaluate this metric over different time domains.\n- Compare versions of this plot over life phases and other time intervals.')
_("The plot below shows the gender distribution of my social time. Specifically, this plot is in units of person-hours/day, meaning that an hour spent with two friends counts for twice as much as an hour spent with one. This seems like a reasonable way to answer the question 'How much time do I spend with people of different genders?'")

_("Errors in `Metaproject` attribution mostly come from `Project` instances which don't cleanly fit into a single `Metaproject`. For example, `Project.{5}` contains tasks for both rec riding and bike maintenance, which belong to {3} and {2}, respectively.

_('*2023-04*: Added rough tracking of sleep quality. Long periods lying awake or otherwise not sleeping are now roughly tracked as tasks with descriptions under `Project.{0}`. These tasks no longer count toward measurements of sleep time duration. Change reduces the upward bias of sleep durations.')
_("In 2022, the scant social time contained almost no time with {1} or {0}s. It's also when I have the most time with {2}s logged. But I hesitate to conclude much from that observation, because in 2022 I was more consistent in logging time spent with {2}s than in other periods due to the overall low social time. ")
_("The total profile of this plot exactly matches that of the *Average Person-Hours by Gender* plot in the previous section; it's only the division of the total profile among the categories which differs. Some hypotheses presented in that subsection are confirmed here. I don't spend that much time overall with family, and the time I do is concentrated in spikes when I visit my dad's family and around holidays. It appears that most of the dip in 2021-02 comes from a sharp reduction in time with {0}s, but I don't recall what happened at work which would have caused that reduction.")
