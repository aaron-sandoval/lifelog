# README: Lifelog Data Analysis
## Introduction
The project spans from data collection and formatting to presentation.

Though it was suited fine for the original small productivity exercise, the scope of data features has blown way past what the app that I use for data collection, [timesheet.io](https://timesheet.io/), was intended for. Most of the juicy information, included that for all of the features listed above, is all collected in a single string entry. So about 90% of this project has been feature engineering, designing data structures to represent one's day-to-day life, parsing that one string, unpacking the mess of shortcuts I've used to streamline collection, and fixing a litany of rookie mistakes.
